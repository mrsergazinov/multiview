## Code Organization

The repository is organized as follows:

### Directories

- **src/**  
  Contains the implementation of all models and data generators.

- **plots/**  
  Contains figures from the paper.

- **data/**  
  Contains processed data for:
  1. Colorectal cancer
  2. Nutrigeromic mice

### Scripts

- **install_all.sh**  
  Code to install all necessary Python and R packages.
  
- **demo_clusters.R**  
  Reproduces **Figure 1**, exhibiting clustering of singular values of \( P_{\text{col}\, X_1} P_{\text{col}\, X_2} \).

- **demo_clusters_ajive.R**  
  Reproduces **Figure 4**, comparing the analyzed spectrum between our method and AJIVE.

- **demo_k_views.R**  
  Runs simulations for *k* views.

- **summary_k_views.R**  
  Reproduces **Tables 1 and 4**; summarizes the results of the simulations for *k* views.

- **demo_real_coad.R**  
  Reproduces **Table 2**; contains code for the colorectal cancer data analysis.

- **demo_real_coad_plots.R**  
  Reproduces **Figure 2**; plots the results of the colorectal cancer data analysis.

- **demo_real_mice.R**  
  Reproduces **Table 3**; contains code for the nutrigeromic mice data analysis.

- **demo_real_mice_plots.R**  
  Reproduces **Figure 3**; plots the results of the nutrigeromic mice data analysis.

- **demo_epsilon_bootstrap.R**  
  Reproduces **Figures 5 and 6**; tests the error of the bootstrap estimate of \( \epsilon \).
